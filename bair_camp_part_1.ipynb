    "At the end of today, you will be expected to, as a group, submit a dictionary of body parameters for *two* different robots. Be sure to specify the name of the base robot (ant, hopper, or walker) along with each set of parameters. Then on Thursday, your goal will be to have the robot learn to run (or hop) as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Friday, your group will present your most interesting findings from today's part 1 and Thursday's part 2. This includes how you decided to design your robot, what you learned trying to get the robot to run today, and what you learned when getting the robot to learn on Thursday. Your group leader can help you figure out what to include in your presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will have time on Friday morning to put together slides for your presentation, so don't worry about making them today, but be sure to *write down notes* for what you will include from today's project, and be sure to _download any videos_ that you want to use in your presentation!\n",
