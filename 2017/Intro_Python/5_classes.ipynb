Classes are quite unlike the other data types, in that they are much more flexible.

Classes are a rich topic, so you will learn just enough here to dive into the projects you'd like to get started on.\n",

If you are unfamiliar with CamelCase, it is a convention where each letter that starts a word is capitalized, with no underscores in the name.

    "#### Rocket Attributes\n",
    "- Start with a copy of the Rocket class, either one you made from a previous exercise or the latest version from the [last section](#adding_method).\n",
    "- Add several of your own attributes to the \\_\\_init\\_\\_() function. The values of your attributes can be set automatically by the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ function, or they can be set by paremeters passed into \\_\\_init\\_\\_().\n",
    "- Create a rocket and print the values for the attributes you have created, to show they have been set correctly.\n",
    "- Create a small fleet of rockets, and set different values for one of the attributes you have created. Print the values of these attributes for each rocket in your fleet, to show that they have been set properly for each rocket.\n",
    "- If you are not sure what kind of attributes to add, you could consider storing the height of the rocket, the crew size, the name of the rocket, the speed of the rocket, or many other possible characteristics of a rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rocket Methods\n",
    "- Start with a copy of the Rocket class, either one you made from a previous exercise or the latest version from the [last section](#adding_method).\n",
    "- Add a new method to the class. This is probably a little more challenging than adding attributes, but give it a try.\n",
    "    - Think of what rockets do, and make a very simple version of that behavior using print statements. For example, rockets lift off when they are launched. You could make a method called *launch()*, and all it would do is print a statement such as \"The rocket has lifted off!\" If your rocket has a name, this sentence could be more descriptive.\n",
    "    - You could make a very simple *land_rocket()* method that simply sets the x and y values of the rocket back to 0. Print the position before and after calling the *land_rocket()* method to make sure your method is doing what it's supposed to.\n",
    "    - If you enjoy working with math, you could implement a *safety_check()* method. This method would take in another rocket object, and call the get_distance() method on that rocket. Then it would check if that rocket is too close, and print a warning message if the rocket is too close. If there is zero distance between the two rockets, your method could print a message such as, \"The rockets have crashed!\" (Be careful; getting a zero distance could mean that you accidentally found the distance between a rocket and itself, rather than a second rocket.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Person Class\n",
    "- Modeling a person is a classic exercise for people who are trying to learn how to write classes. We are all familiar with characteristics and behaviors of people, so it is a good exercise to try.\n",
    "    - Define a Person() class.\n",
    "    - In the \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ function, define several attributes of a person. Good attributes to consider are name, age, place of birth, and anything else you like to know about the people in your life.\n",
    "    - Write one method. This could be as simple as *introduce_yourself()*. This method would print out a statement such as, \"Hello, my name is Eric.\"\n",
    "    - You could also make a method such as *age_person()*. A simple version of this method would just add 1 to the person's age.\n",
    "        - A more complicated version of this method would involve storing the person's birthdate rather than their age, and then calculating the age whenever the age is requested. But dealing with dates and times is not particularly easy if you've never done it in any other programming language before.\n",
    "    - Create a person, set the attribute values appropriately, and print out information about the person.\n",
    "    - Call your method on the person you created. Make sure your method executed properly; if the method does not print anything out directly, print something before and after calling the method to make sure it did what it was supposed to."
